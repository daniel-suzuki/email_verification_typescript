### For future reference:
Currently the index files for both the 'ValidateUser' and 'CreateUser' folders share the same repositories. This is because the project uses local arrays to withhold the data and, therefore, it needes to be shared accross multiples classes. However, I intend to migrate to MOngoDB or PostgreSQL in the near future.
